# as far as I've gotten with the software:
#   blank_routine: used while testing, just blank arduino script so I could leave arduino wired up without worrying about it
#   carStateMachine: arduino script car will run on, thoroughly commented
#   udp_run.c/run: c script that will run on pi at launch, not quite working yet
#   udp_test.c/test: c script I'm running on my computer to test pi response
#   makefile: compilation for both c scripts
#   serialComm.py: python script that goes between pi and arduino
