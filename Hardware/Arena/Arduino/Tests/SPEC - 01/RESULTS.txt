SPEC - 01

Soccar Project

SPEC 01 was a resounding success as well. The time
clearly counts down steadily on the LCD display. There
was also some additional functionality included in the
test, which allowed the countdown to be reset, although
the only capacity in which this was tested was in the sense
that it did not hinder any of the normal countdown
functionality.

There was an issue with getting the countdown time to go one
second at a time, but it turned out to be an issue with subtracting
the counter's value from itself once per loop, leading to an exponentially
decreasing time cycle.

The video shows the clear functionality of the counter, and the photo
shows that the counter stops when it reaches 00:00.
