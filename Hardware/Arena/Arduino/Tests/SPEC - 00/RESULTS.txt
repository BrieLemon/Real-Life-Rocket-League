SPEC - 00 RESULTS

Soccar Project

SPEC 00 was a resounding success. The LCD display was visible
from all angles and clearly displayed the words "Hello World"

The LCD display did not waver and displayed the words clearly
throughout the duration of the test. This means that the 
development team can continue to SPEC 01 and also continue
working with the display.

The folder containing the test also contains several images
showing the clarity of the display from the front and several
angles for any interested third parties.
