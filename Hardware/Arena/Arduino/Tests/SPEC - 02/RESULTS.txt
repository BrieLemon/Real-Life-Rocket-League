SPEC - 02

Soccar Project

SPEC 02 was also a success, although some compromises
had to be made in order to get the display functioning
correctly. The second line had to be written first in order
to correctly display the time, and although the time was supposed
to be right justified, the writing to the LCD display would go blank
if there was not a gap between the word TIME and the end of the
display.

However, the display is still readable and looks good, so this test
was a pass. The string concatenation and formatting work 
wonderfully.
