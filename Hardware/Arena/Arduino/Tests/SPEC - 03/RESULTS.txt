RESULTS


Overall the results of the test were very good. The API allowed
the variable to be monitored, and allowed a rapid reset of the 
variable with the function call.

The subscribed event failed because the console would not allow
me to publish events in such a way that I would be able to easily see 
them, although this can be worked around by using the function call
command.
